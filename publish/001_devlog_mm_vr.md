## Devlog: Building the Main Menu for a VR Museum

**Today's Task: Working on the Main Menu for a 3D Museum**

### Project Overview
Today's task involves working on the main menu for a 3D museum accessible in both virtual reality (VR) and desktop platforms. The project, built using Unity, aims to provide an immersive experience for users to explore the museum's exhibits.

### Recent Progress
In today's session, I focused on implementing some essential features within the main menu. Specifically, I designed and built radio buttons that allow users to select their preferred mode of accessing the museumâ€”either VR or desktop.

Additionally, I tackled the challenge of passing game data between scenes. I finally learned how singletons and player preferences works and can now transfer crucial player data between scenes, ensuring a seamless experience when transitioning between different areas of the museum.

### Challenges Faced
As I continue to work on this project, one of the ongoing challenges I've encountered is my relative unfamiliarity with Unity and C#. However, I am determined to overcome these hurdles and am actively learning on the fly to expand my skills and improve the project.

### Upcoming Plans
Looking ahead, at the roadmap for the project, one of my next tasks is to rebuild the options menu, offering users more customization choices for their experience. This will include features such as allowing users to change the appearance of their avatar and seamlessly transferring that data to subsequent scenes. In addition, I plan to incorporate settings that let users adjust preferences like continuous turn versus snap turn, as well as modify their in-game names.

By expanding the options menu, I aim to provide users with a more personalized and immersive experience within the museum. I am excited to work on these enhancements and create a robust and customizable interface for our users.
