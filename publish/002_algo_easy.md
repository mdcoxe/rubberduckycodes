# Getting Back in the Coding Game: Tackling an Easy Code Challenge in Python

After a few years of coding, I decided it was time to jump back into the world of code challenges. My goal? To knock off some rust and brush up on skills I used to have. To ease back into it, I picked an easy code challenge from Codewars that seemed like the perfect starting point.

## #The Challenge

The task at hand is to create a Python function that progressively concatenates pairs of characters from the left and right sides of a given string. Additionally, each pair should be followed by a number representing the position of the pair. If the input string has an odd length, we should omit the central character.

Here are a couple of examples to illustrate this straightforward challenge:

Input: "abcdef"
Output: 'af1be2cd3'

Input: "abc!def"
Output: 'af1be2cd3'

Now, let's dive into my journey as I tackle this easy but fun coding challenge.
### The First Attempt

Every coder has their moments, and my first attempt at solving this challenge was certainly one of mine! I dove headfirst into the problem without considering some fundamental principles of Python strings.

Here's what my initial solution looked like:

```python
def char_concat(word):
    new_str = ""
    new_list = list(word)
    num = len(new_list)
    middle_index = 0
    counta = 1

    if (num % 2 != 0):
        middle_index = num // 2
        new_list.pop(middle_index)

    for i in range(int(num/2)):
        new_str = new_str + str(new_list[i]) + str(new_list[-1]) + str(counta)
        new_list.pop()
        counta += 1

    return new_str
```

In this attempt, I started by converting the string into a list, which was unnecessary. I then attempted to remove the middle element (if present) and use a `for` loop with an index (`i`) to concatenate the characters. However, I mishandled the index and used the `pop()` method to remove elements from the list, which only complicated things.

### The Lightbulb Moment

After a bit of reflection and some quality time with my rubber ducky (a coding practice where you explain your code to an inanimate object), I realized that there was a simpler way to approach this challenge.

Here's my final, working solution:

```python
def char_concat(word):
    new_str = ""

    for i in range(len(word)//2):
        new_str = new_str + word[i] + word[-(i+1)] + str(i+1)

    return new_str
```

In this revised solution, I remembered I could work directly with the string, without the need to convert it into a list. I used a `for` loop to iterate through the characters, and I correctly utilized the index `i` to concatenate the characters and add the position number. This simplified approach not only solved the challenge but also made the code much cleaner and more efficient. 

And that's how I conquered this coding challenge by taking a step back, simplifying my approach, and using the power of Python strings to my advantage. Remember, debugging and problem-solving are all part of the coding journey, and even the simplest challenges can teach us valuable lessons. Now, can you refactor my code further?  Or, better yet, do you have a more efficient readable alternative?

The next time you're stuck on a coding problem, don't forget to consult your trusty rubber ducky!
