# About Me 

Hey there! I'm Michael, a software engineer with a passion for creating meaningful experiences through code. With a diverse background in software engineering and a commitment to continuous learning, I'm thrilled to welcome you to my devlog.


My journey into the world of development began with a deep-rooted passion for technology. From my early days building webpages in grade-school to enlisting in the US Air Force as a geophysical science technician, and later teaching others how to operate new systems, I have always been captivated by the inner workings of computers. Throughout my career, I played a crucial role as a liaison between software engineers and end users, troubleshooting issues and facilitating smooth interactions. However, it wasn't until mid-2019 that I had the opportunity to fully embrace my true calling and transition into a software engineer, allowing me to combine my love for technology with my desire to create through code.

As my learning progressed I realized I needed a little more structure to fullfill my passion and enrolled in the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp in the winter of 2020-2021. There, I immersed myself in the MERN stack and dabbled in Ruby on Rails. As a backend engineer for the non-profit organization Greenstand, I had the privilege of using my skills in JavaScript to make a positive impact. Later, I interned with Instra.ai, honing my frontend skills with React Native. In 2021, I joined AES, LLC as a software engineer, primarily utilizing Python, JavaScript, and C#. Currently, I'm delving into the fascinating realm of XR, working with Unity and C#.


From an early age, I've been captivated by the inner workings of computers. I initially discovered my passion for tech while building webpages in school, and that spark has only grown brighter over time. In 2019, I decided to seize the opportunity to pursue my true calling: becoming a software engineer.


Through my devlog, I aim to provide you with a wealth of valuable insights. Whether it's sharing step-by-step tutorials, practical code snippets, or exciting updates on my latest projects, I want to equip you with the tools, tips, and inspiration needed to excel in your own coding journey.


One thing I want to emphasize is that I'm no stranger to imposter syndrome. Like many in the field, I've faced those moments of self-doubt. However, I firmly believe that we grow stronger together by embracing and sharing our experiences. So, rest assured, I'll be right here alongside you, navigating the challenges and celebrating the victories.


Looking ahead, my future goals revolve around the immersive world of VR/AR applications that facilitate learning and foster innovation. I'm excited to dive deeper into this space and create transformative experiences that empower others.


I encourage you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcoxe/). Let's engage in conversations, share ideas, and support each other on this incredible journey. I'm eager to learn from you and contribute to our vibrant community.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Together, we'll unlock the limitless possibilities of development!
